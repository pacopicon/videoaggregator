## videoaggregator

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the app by first packaging the files to be served: `npm run build`
3. Spin up the server: `"dev:server"` At this point running the server will automatically call the Vimeo API (see `server/app.js`).  The call will log to the console the json response.
